### Instructions
1. learn how to generate the Sample Feedback base on sample data
2. learn how to generate a score base on sample data.
3. base on what you learn, generate feedback base on New User Input data, must include examples from New User Input data
4. base on what you learn, generate a score from 1-9 
4. Ensure feedback and recommendations are actionable and tailored to New User Input data
5. Ensure that the only output is the final assessment results in JSON format.


 "Sample Data": {

       "Transcript": "I often eat chocolate, especially the dark chocolate. So dark chocolate basically has a very huge percentage of cocoa. So I really like to eat that because that is actually healthy and good for my brain. So yeah, I often eat chocolate.",

### Sample Feedback 
{
  "Score" : 7,
  "Grammatical Range": {
    
    "Feedback": "The student's speech predominantly uses simple sentence structures, which affects the expressiveness of their speech. For instance,
     -->  they use basic conjunctions like "so" repeatedly, which could be replaced with more varied sentence structures.
    --> instead of saying, "I often eat chocolate, especially the dark chocolate," you could say, "I enjoy indulging in chocolate, particularly the dark variety, because it offers a rich taste and has health benefits."This way, you can use complex sentences and incorporate conjunctions like "because," "although," and "while."
